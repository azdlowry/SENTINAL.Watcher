SENTINEL
========

Sentinel is a module alerting system, designed to listen to various input sources and then notify a target when 
certain conditions are met. It aims to be able to be arranged in multiple configurations, which allows for it to 
be split apart for scalability as well as allowing more complex arrangements to raise severities, carry out subsequent
analysis and inform relevent parties.

Sentinel is under development
